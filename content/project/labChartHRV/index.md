## Rationale

[LabChartâ€™s HRV module](https://www.adinstruments.com/products/hrv) contains HRV report file in text format which is quite hard to *manually* extract data to perform an analysis.

## Goal

The goal of **labChartHRV** package is to *automate* the process of data import from multiple LabChart's HRV report files into a tidy [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org).
