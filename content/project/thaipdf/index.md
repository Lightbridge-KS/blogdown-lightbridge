## Rationale

It is not easy to create a PDF from R Markdown written in **Thai language** since there are LaTeX configurations that need to be added to the preamble of the document. That's why I build [thaipdf](https://lightbridge-ks.github.io/thaipdf/) package.


## Goal

The goal is to facilitate R users who not know very much about LaTeX to have an ability to **knit** Thai R Markdown document to a PDF **out of the box**. 

Also, for pro LaTeX user can also benefit from this package in that this package provides helper funcions to use template for Thai language configuration quickly.
