## Rationale

After students have finished quizzes from [Moodle](https://moodle.org) platform, [Moodle Quiz Reports](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Quiz_reports) will usually be collected, processed, graded, and combined with other reports to a single spreadsheet or store in a database before the final grading process. The intermediary score processing steps could be tedious if perform manually. Luckily, the **Moodle Quiz Reports** have some underlying structures that provides an opportunity to automate this processes with data manipulation software. That's why I've build this [`{moodleQuiz}`](https://github.com/Lightbridge-KS/moodleQuiz/) R package.


## Goal

The goal of this package it to provide a high-level ready-to-use functions for cleaning, encoding, filtering, and combining studentâ€™s score and responses from [Moodle Quiz Reports](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Quiz_reports).

Moreover, I've included the functions from `{moodleQuiz}` as a [*business logic engine*](https://engineering-shiny.org/structuring-project.html#business-logic-and-application-logic) to drive [this Shiny app](https://si-physio-intern.shinyapps.io/SELECx_combine_quiz/) using for student's score processing from [SELECx](http://selecx.si.mahidol.ac.th) (a Moodle platform from Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Thailand).
