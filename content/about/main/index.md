  Hello, I am a medical doctor who gains interest in software developing and data science.
  I am a real geek. I love computer software and developing tools for others (including myself) to use in real life and also for fun!
  
  My first programming language is [R](https://www.r-project.org), and now it is my favorite tool to analyse data, build R-package, and build cool [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application.
  
  The aim of this blog is to spread knowledge to the word in the areas of programming, data science, productivity, and including life in general.
  
  I live in Bangkok, Thailand with my family, my dog, and good friends.
  
  This blog is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
