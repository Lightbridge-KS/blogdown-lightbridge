This book contains collection of relatively self-contained experimentation and code examples for statistical test and machine learning with `R`. 

Please feel free to use it if you might find it helpful üëç.

NB: Many of the contents come from other great people, YouTube, or blog post. Some of them I adapted to fit my own use.
